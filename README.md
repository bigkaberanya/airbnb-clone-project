This project is a simplified clone of Airbnb to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments Project goals include (User Management, Property Management, Booking system, Payment Processing, Review System, and Data Optimization) We will be using a technology stack including (Django, Django REST framework, PostgreSQL, Celery, Redis, Docker, CI/CD Pipelines), which will help us to perform our task in various ways
Team Roles and Responsibilities
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic. Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations. DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services. QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

Technology Stack Overview
Django: A high-level Python web framework used to build a RESTful API. Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs. PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage. GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data. Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments. Redis: Used for caching and session management. Docker: A Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments. CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

Database Design Overview
Entities and Relationships User

id, name, email, password, role

Can be a guest or a host

Property

id, title, description, price, location, owner_id
Belongs to a user (host), can have multiple bookings and reviews
Booking

id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date, status
Tied to a user and a property
Review

id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment, created_at
One user can leave one review per property
Payment

id, booking_id, amount, status, payment_method
Linked to a specific booking for transaction processing Relationship A User can book many Properties A Property can have many Bookings and Reviews A Booking belongs to one User and one Property A Payment is linked to one Booking
Features Breakdown
User Management: Users can register, log in, update profiles, and toggle between guest and host roles.
Property Management: Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings with descriptions, images, and pricing.
Booking System: Guests can search properties and make bookings based on availability.
Review System: Guests can leave reviews and rate properties after completing their stay.
Payment Integration: Secure online payments for bookings, with real-time payment status updates.
Search & Filter: Users can search for properties by location, price, date, and other filters.
API Security Overview
Authentication: Only registered users can access protected endpoints. JWT (JSON Web Token) will be used.
Authorization: Ensures users can only perform actions permitted for their role (e.g., only hosts can add properties).
Rate Limiting: Protects the API from abuse by limiting request frequency.
Data Encryption: All sensitive data (like passwords and payment info) is encrypted.
Input Validation: Prevents common attacks like SQL injection and XSS by validating all inputs. Why it matters:
Protects user privacy and financial information
Secures system access and data integrity
Maintains platform trust and compliance ####### CI/CD Pipelines Overview CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code to production. Tools:
GitHub Actions – Automatically runs tests and builds on every push or pull request.
Docker – Containerizes the application for consistent deployment across machines.
Vercel/Heroku (or similar) – Deploys the frontend and backend quickly and reliably. Benefits:
Detects bugs early through automated testing
Speeds up deployment and iteration
Ensures consistent and reliable builds across environments
